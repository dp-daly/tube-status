# React Tube Line Challenge

Weâ€™d like you to build an App to monitor the current status of the London Underground.

Using the TFL API (https://api.tfl.gov.uk/line/mode/tube/status), build a mobile-oriented web app that:
- Lists the London Underground lines sorted alphabetically
- Shows the current status of each line
- Bonus 1: Create a component for a **Line** and return this component when mapping your lines, passing through all the relevant info as props.
- Bonus 2: Each Line should be styled using its appropriate color (e.g. Central line with 'red' font)
- Bonus 3: Update the status every 5 minutes

Feel free to style the app as you wish, but see "example.png" for a rough idea on what to produce.

## Tips

Remember to test endpoints with Postman/Insomnia before attempting to use them in your code.
Use your Chrome Developer Tools and `console.log`!
